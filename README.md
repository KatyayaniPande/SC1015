# Data Science Salary Analysis

Predicting the salaries for data science job postings is a complex task, as there are numerous factors that can influence the salary range for a given job title and location. However, by analyzing a large dataset of job postings and salaries, we can develop a model that accurately predicts the salary range for a job posting based on the features of the job title, location, industry, and other relevant factors.

Specifically, we aim to analyse the salaries in the data science industry. We will use a combination of machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to preprocess and transform the data, identify the most important features, and train a model that accurately predicts the salary range for job postings.

To evaluate the performance of our model, we will use various metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared value as well as check for any possible overfitting using Cross-Validation. Additionally, we will visualize the results of our analysis using interactive dashboards and data visualization tools to provide insights into the key factors that drive data science salaries. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a valuable resource for job seekers, employers, and researchers who want to understand the job market for data science roles and optimize their hiring and recruiting strategies.
